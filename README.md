# Genome Assembly, Annotation, and Metabolic Pathway Prediction

## Background





##Overview

Bacterial genomes from patients that have multiple bacterial isolates sequenced were assembled using SPAdes v 3.15.2 via the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) v. 3.6.12. Genome assemblies were also annotated using PATRIC. The features.txt file produced from each annotation was parsed via Python v.3.8.5 to extract the enzyme codes (EC) needed to generate metabolic maps using KEGG Mapper-Color; a web tool for metabolic pathway prediction.
